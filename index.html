                        </h3>
                        <p> To get started, you need to do the following: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>DevOps</strong> will create a project on eclipse and push it to GitHub. Add your team members as collaborators on that repository. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Team members will clone that repository on their eclipse (Check useful links tab for info on how to clone github repo onto eclipse)</li>
                            <li>
                                All team members will read and understand the requirements document fully

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Architect</strong> will discuss with the team members and come up with the design such as classes, attributes, methods, access modifiers for attributes, constructors , toString. Architect can write the design on a piece of paper or a shared document. 

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Architect will discuss with team members and come up with the logic for each menu option

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Business Analyst</strong> will invite PM to join their breakout room and discuss the design solution.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once PM gives the go ahead, <strong>Team lead</strong> will assign work to each member

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Team members would need a baseline code to begin implementing features. Team lead / Architect can share their screen and implement the baseline code like creating the model/POJO classes, and a class that contains a phonebook list and the main method.
                                <br/>Create these classes and push the code on “master/main” branch
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                QA will pull this code, run the project. Initially the main method will be empty so the project won’t do anything. Once QA gives a go-ahead that the code so far is error-free and runs, move to the next step.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once step 7 is completed, each member of the team will create their own feature branch (give it a feature name like “search-functionality”) from the master/main branch. Create one branch per feature. Do not merge multiple features in the same branch. Don’t write your name in commits, feature names etc. I will be able to see who implemented which part of the code by viewing push and pull requests on the repository
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each team member will implement their assigned work. This project is open book so feel free to use any resource online or otherwise. DO NOT copy paste code from anywhere. 

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once done implementing your assigned work, push your code to your branch, Open a pull request to merge your branch with master. Do not merge the pull request. Assign someone to review your code.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once your code is reviewed and you get a go ahead, merge your branch with master branch.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once all team members are done implementing their feature/s and merging with master, QA will pull the code , change branch to master and test by running your code several times. Any issues will be logged under issues tab on GitHub and QA/BA will assign the issue to a team member of their choice. 

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Assigned team members will create a new branch from main, call it bug-fix-(issue-number), pull it on eclipse, switch to that branch and fix the issue. Once done, you can push the code and create a new pull request.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Process continues until QA gives a go ahead to make your application live - i.e in our case, let the Project Manager know that the project is completed.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                            Requirements
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            
In this project, you will write an application that creates and stores contacts. It can store information about people and organizations.
In the app, you can store phone numbers of different people and different companies, like your favorite pizza shop or your bank. 
<br/></p>

<p>There should be a base class Contact that contains information relevant to both an organization and a person, like <code>name, phone number (which would be a String) and createdAt (which would be the datetime when the object was created example: <code>2022-03-22T22:39:53.737179</code></code>) . 
Contact will have a stand-alone verifier that validates if a phone number entered by the user is valid or not. This method will potentially be used by different applications by passing the string phone number as a parameter. This method is stand-alone logic and hence can be called without having to create an object of Contact. A phone number is valid if it contains 12 characters.</p>
<p>Additionally, Person will have <code>email and date of birth (date object) </code>and Organization will have a <code>website.</code></p>
<p>
    You can perform several actions in your phonebook application: 
<code>[add, list, count, info, delete, search, exit]</code>

            <li>
                Before building the object and storing it in the phonebook list, check if the phone number entered by the user is valid not not. Contact has a verifier that can check it for you. If the phone number is valid, retain the data entered by the user, if not, assign phone number to “[No Number]” text.
            </li>
            <li>
